# Cookie Stand
201 Class Project - OOP JavaScript

In this project I created a site for the Salmon Cookies company. The client wanted a main page, a style guide page, merchandise page, and a page for sales where he could view how many cookies are sold in a day in table form. He also wanted to be able to enter new store data into a form and have it render the cookie sales to the page.

N7 - Created object literals for each store. Rendered all stores in list format to the page.

N8 - Created a basic style sheet.

N9 -  Refactored cookie stand objects using a constructor and instances.

N10 - Added an input form to sales data page and bound this to an event listener. Data is now rendering to store in table format.

N11 - Linked all pages to one another. Added a footer to each page. Made everything look nicer with CSS.
